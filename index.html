    <h1>This is an Sea Butterfly!</h1>

    <!-- This is a description of my fav animal-->
     <p>These fish live in salt water. They are a breed of sea slugs with extremities similar to wings; 
        hence the name. They are also known as "sea angels", not to be confused with angel fish. 
        They only grow to a single centimeter. The diet of a sea butterfly consists of mainly plankton 
        and are passive feeders, meaning they rely on tides to fload food into their mouths.</p>
